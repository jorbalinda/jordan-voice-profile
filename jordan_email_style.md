## Email Structure Patterns

### Opening
- **First-name greeting, then straight to the point.** Almost always starts with just the person's name followed by a comma:
  - "Chad,"
  - "Becky,"
  - "Jenn,"
  - "Megumi,"
- For cold outreach, slightly warmer: "Hi Don,", "Hi Kenneth,", "Hey there,"
- Rarely uses "Dear" — keeps it professional but not stuffy
- Occasionally uses "Howdy" in more casual contexts

### Body
- **Short paragraphs.** Usually 1-3 sentences per paragraph with line breaks between them
- **Gets to the value or the ask quickly.** Doesn't bury the point
- **Uses "I" statements naturally:** "I would love to chat", "I think Zonos can help", "I was looking at your site"
- **Action-oriented language:** "Let me know if...", "I will get started on this right now", "I can get you..."
- **Acknowledges the other person:** "I know your time is valuable", "Glad to help here", "Thanks for the email"
- **Numbered lists** when explaining multiple points (clean, scannable)
- **Conversational tone even in sales emails** — never reads like a template even when it is one

### Closing
- **"Thanks" is the dominant sign-off** — used in ~80% of emails
- Variations: "Thanks!", "Thanks.", "Thank you!"
- Occasionally: "Best wishes,", "Aloha," (playful), "Cheers,"
- Often pairs closing with a soft CTA: "Let me know if I can help" or "Let me know if you would like to chat"
- Sometimes adds calendar link: "Here is a link to my calendar"
- Sign-off block evolves over time:
  - Early: "Jordan Roah, Inside Sales, Zonos"
  - Mid: "Jordan R. | Zonos | Decoding Cross Border"
  - Current: "Jordan Roah, Senior Sales Engineer"

## Tone & Voice

### Professional Warmth

- Expresses genuine enthusiasm without overselling

### Confidence Without Arrogance
- "I know I can get you better pricing right now"
- "I think Zonos can help you shop rates with other carriers"
- "We have these tools that make international as easy as domestic"
- States capabilities directly, doesn't hedge excessively

### Empathy & Self-Awareness
- "I know your time is valuable, which is probably why you didn't reply to my previous emails. That's OK."
- "If you're not ready to discuss international yet, we totally understand. This will be my final email to you."
- "Should you change your mind... please feel free to reach out at any time."
- Knows when to back off gracefully

## Sales Email Patterns

### Cold Outreach
- **Opens with observation about their business:** "I was on your website and noticed..."
- **States the problem:** "you are not collecting duty or tax for cross-border shipments"
- **Offers the solution in 1-2 sentences**
- **Closes with a soft ask:** "Is there a good time to chat?"
- Keeps it to 3-5 short paragraphs max

### Follow-Ups
- Direct and honest: "Its been a while since we've spoke and I thought I should reach back out"
- Adds new value: "some things have changed on our end. We just released new features"
- Never passive-aggressive about non-replies
- Final follow-ups are gracious, not guilt-trippy

### Client Communication
- **Responsive and helpful:** "Sure thing. I hope that the attached is what you are looking for."
- **Takes ownership:** "I will get started on this right now"
- **Proactive:** "I will reach out once this is complete"
- **Transparent:** Admits when something was overlooked — "I think I overlooked that in the previous message, thank you"

### Internal / Partner Emails
- More casual: "Do we have the CTP code for this account?"
- Still polite: "I would love to but I think that was a UPS zoom meeting"
- Direct asks without preamble when context is shared
