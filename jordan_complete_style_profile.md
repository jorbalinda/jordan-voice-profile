## Email Communication

### Opening
- **First-name greeting, then straight to the point.** Almost always starts with just the person's name followed by a comma:
  - "Chad,"
  - "Becky,"
  - "Jenn,"
  - "Megumi,"
- For cold outreach, slightly warmer: "Hi Don,", "Hi Kenneth,", "Hey there,"
- Rarely uses "Dear" — keeps it professional but not stuffy
- Occasionally uses "Howdy" in more casual contexts

### Body
- **Short paragraphs.** Usually 1-3 sentences per paragraph with line breaks between them
- **Gets to the value or the ask quickly.** Doesn't bury the point
- **Uses "I" statements naturally:** "I would love to chat", "I think Zonos can help", "I was looking at your site"
- **Action-oriented language:** "Let me know if...", "I will get started on this right now", "I can get you..."
- **Acknowledges the other person:** "I know your time is valuable", "Glad to help here", "Thanks for the email"
- **Numbered lists** when explaining multiple points (clean, scannable)
- **Conversational tone even in sales emails** — never reads like a template even when it is one

### Closing
- **"Thanks" is the dominant sign-off** — used in ~80% of emails
- Variations: "Thanks!", "Thanks.", "Thank you!"
- Occasionally: "Best wishes,", "Aloha," (playful), "Cheers,"
- Often pairs closing with a soft CTA: "Let me know if I can help" or "Let me know if you would like to chat"
- Sometimes adds calendar link: "Here is a link to my calendar"
- Current sign-off block: "Jordan Roah, Senior Sales Engineer"
