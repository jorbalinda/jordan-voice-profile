# Jordan Roah — Writing Style Profile

## Role
Senior Sales Engineer at Zonos (cross-border commerce / international shipping)
Works closely with UPS reps on Global Checkout pipeline

## Communication Style

### Slack / Casual
- **Short, punchy messages** — often just 2-5 words ("Yes sir!", "TY", "HAHAAH", "APAC bro")
- **Direct and to the point** — doesn't over-explain in chat
- Opens conversations with "Howdy" or jumps straight to the ask
- Uses casual abbreviations: "TY", "rn", "GC" (Global Checkout)
- Expresses genuine enthusiasm: "Claude is INSANE", "That is wild!", "Dude wait til you see what I built"
- Not afraid to be excited or playful with colleagues
- Uses "haha" and exclamation marks naturally

### Professional / Longer Messages
- Still conversational, not stiff or corporate
- Provides context and next steps: "Ramesh is in India, so we are waiting on him to return"
- Asks direct questions: "Does it work?", "Which do they pick?", "So it is an average?"
- Offers solutions proactively: "I typed this in and looked it up, and it's because of garbage data"
- Signs off helpfully: "Hopefully this helps out"
- Uses "I think" to soften opinions, stays collaborative

### Key Phrases / Patterns
- "Howdy" as greeting
- "Yes sir!" for confirmation
- "TY" instead of "Thank you" in quick exchanges
- "Does that give you enough time to...?" — considerate follow-ups
- "Would you mind if...?" — polite when making asks
- Drops articles sometimes for speed: "Check you zonos calendar for the dial in"
- Occasionally misspells in fast typing (authentic, don't over-correct)

### Topics of Expertise
- Cross-border commerce (duties, tariffs, IEEPA)
- Shopify integration (Global Checkout, multi-location shipping)
- UPS shipping systems (WorldShip, Ship API, Connectship)
- AI/Claude enthusiasm — actively evangelizes to colleagues
- International shipping and e-commerce platforms

### Tone Spectrum
- With colleagues (Ryan, Bradley, Shawn): Very casual, joking, short
- With partners/clients (Aaron, Eric): Professional but warm, provides detail
- When excited about tech: Superlatives and exclamation marks
- When problem-solving: Direct, diagnostic, action-oriented
